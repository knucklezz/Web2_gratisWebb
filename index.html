                    <p>...I can't tell you. Well, wherever you're going, take me with you! I can't, Clara. I wish it didn't have to be this way...but just believe me when I say that I'll never forget you and that...I love you. I don't understand what you're trying to say. Clara...I don't think there's anyway that you can understand it.(Marty is still watching the gun demonstration.) (to Marty) Young man, want to give it a try? No, no, thanks. Hey Doc, this... (He realizes that Doc isn't there and he looks out onto the dance floor.) Son! Sonny boy! (Marty ignores the salesman. He keeps his eyes on Doc and Clara as they begin to dance.)Are your folks home yet? I bought pizza for everyone. (She holds up the pizza, and it’s only a few inches long.) Oh, who's going to eat all that? Oh, I will! (Skyway) Damn this traffic! Jennifer, that is old Jennifer, usually gets home around now. I hope we're not too late.Hey Biff, she's all fixed up just like you wanted, but I couldn't get it started! You got some kind of a kill switch on this thing? (The camera pulls out to reveal 2015 Biff behind a tree. He watches as 1955 Biff opens the car door and gets in.) No, you just got to have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me. The bill comes to $302 and 57 cents... 300 bucks? (He gets out of the car.) 300 bucks for a couple of dents? No, hey, that's bullshit Terry."...shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars!" What kind of a future do you call that?! (Hill Valley Library) (The Library is obviously closed for the night, but Doc and Marty manage to break in and are going over old newspapers.) (reading from the newspaper) "Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman whose short temper and a tendency to drool earned him the nickname Mad Dog. He was quick on the trigger and bragged that he had killed 12 men, not including Indians or Chinamen." Does it mention me? Am I one of the twelve?Hoverboard. Alright. (he picks up the hoverboard and puts it in the Delorean.) You know Doc, it's gonna be a hell of long walk back to Hill Valley from here. It's still the safest plan. After all, we can't risk sending you back to a populated area, or to a spot that's geographically unknown. You don't want to crash into some trees that once existed in the past. This is all completely open country! So you'll have plenty of run-out space when you arrive. Remember where you're going there are no roads. There's a small cave over there which will be a perfect place to hide the time vehicle. Well, the new time circuit control tubes are warmed up! (starts the Delorean) Time circuits on. I wrote the letter on September 1st, so we'll send you back the very next day. September 2nd, that's a Wednesday. September 2nd, 1885, 8 AM. I get shot on Monday the 7th, so you have 5 days to locate me. According to my letter I'm a blacksmith, so I probably have a shop somewhere. All you have to do is drive the time vehicle directly towards that screen accelerating at 88 miles per hour. Wait a minute, Doc. If I drive straight towards the screen, I'll crash into those Indians. (Indicating a mural painting of Indians behind the movie screen.)</p>
